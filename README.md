# E-commerce Back-End ![alt text](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description:

&nbsp; The back-end is designed to help users manage an online store by providing a database to keep track of products, categories, and tags. Users can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) products in the database, along with associated categories and tags. For example, if a user wants to add a new product to their online store, they can use the app to create a new product entry and assign it to a category, such as "electronics" or "home goods". They can also add tags to the product, such as "smart" or "energy-efficient", to help customers find what they're looking for.

The back-end works by using the Sequelize ORM library to interact with a MySQL database. The database schema is defined using models, which are JavaScript classes that extend Sequelize's Model class. Each model represents a table in the database and defines the fields and associations between tables. It also provides a RESTful API using Express.js, which allows clients to interact with the database by sending HTTP requests. The API routes handle CRUD operations for each model and return JSON responses to clients. With the app, managing an online store has never been easier!
