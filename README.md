# User-Management-System ![alt text](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description:

The system is designed to help administrators manage all users by providing a database to track sensitive information. Admins can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) users in the database. For example, if a user wants to add Johnny Depp to their database, they can use the '+ add user' button to create a new entry and assign an email, activity status, as well as phone number. They can also add comments to help administrators retain special information about the user.

The site works real time by using the Sequelize ORM library to interact with a MySQL database. The database schema is defined using a model, which is a JavaScript class extending Sequelize's Model class. The model represents a table in the database and defines fields. It also provides a RESTful API using Express.js, which allows admins to interact with the database by sending HTTP requests. The API routes handle CRUD operations for each model and return JSON responses to clients. There are multiple views that are rendered using express handlebars for the purpose of templating.
